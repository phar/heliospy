This is a pure python port of helios_dac (https://github.com/Grix/helios_dac) interface code.

i just wanted something a bit lighter-weight to drive the vector display, probably not what 
you want to drive your laser show

loads ILDA files and palettes, for doing the animations and stuff

added primitive hershey font text generator

doesnt do much now.. maybe draws a square if your lucky..




todo:
	drop points that are off the screen due to math
